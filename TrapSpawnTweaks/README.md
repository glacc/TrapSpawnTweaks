# Lethal Company Mod Template

Thank you for using the mod template! Here are a few tips to help you on your journey:

## Versioning

BepInEx uses [semantic versioning, or semver](https://semver.org/), for the mod's version info.
To increment it, you can either modify the version tag in the `.csproj` file directly, or use your IDE's UX to increment the version. Below is an example of modifying the `.csproj` file directly:

```xml
<!-- BepInEx Properties -->
<PropertyGroup>
    <AssemblyName>Glacc.TrapSpawnTweaks</AssemblyName>
    <Product>TrapSpawnTweaks</Product>
    <!-- Change to whatever version you're currently on. -->
    <Version>0.0.1</Version>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Your IDE will have the setting in `Package` or `NuGet` under `General` or `Metadata`, respectively.

## Logging

A logger is provided to help with logging to the console. You can access it by doing `Plugin.Logger` in any class outside the `Plugin` class.

***Please use*** `LogDebug()` ***whenever possible, as any other log method will be displayed to the console and potentially cause performance issues for users.***

If you chose to do so, make sure you change the following line in the `BepInEx.cfg` file to see the Debug messages:

```toml
[Logging.Console]

# ... #

## Which log levels to show in the console output.
# Setting type: LogLevel
# Default value: Fatal, Error, Warning, Message, Info
# Acceptable values: None, Fatal, Error, Warning, Message, Info, Debug, All
# Multiple values can be set at the same time by separating them with , (e.g. Debug, Warning)
LogLevels = All
```
